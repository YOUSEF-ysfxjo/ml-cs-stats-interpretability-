# ML vs Stats Interpretability Project

This project explores how statistical tools (hypothesis tests, p-values, confidence intervals) can be combined with machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for interpretability.  
The repository is organized into logical directories: `mlvsstats/` for core code, `notebooks/` for experiments, `data/` for raw and processed datasets, `scripts/` for automation, `tests/` for validation, and `configs/` for configuration.
